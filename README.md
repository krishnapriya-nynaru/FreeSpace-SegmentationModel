## Model Architecture
The HybridNets model architecture is designed for multitask automotive applications, integrating EfficientNet-B0 as the backbone for feature extraction. It employs a BiFPN (Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network) to combine features from different scales, enhancing both detection and segmentation. 

**1. Backbone(EfficientNet-B0) :** EfficientNet-B0 serves as the backbone. It's known for its balance between accuracy and efficiency, using compound scaling to optimize depth, width, and resolution.
This backbone is lightweight, enabling faster inference times while maintaining high accuracy.

**2. BiFPN (Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network) :**
BiFPN enables the fusion of multi-scale features, allowing the network to efficiently combine low-level and high-level information. It supports bidirectional cross-scale connections for more robust feature extraction.
It enhances object detection, segmentation, and lane detection by merging features from different layers, making it easier for the model to process varying input resolutions.

**3. Drivable Area Segmentation Head :** Performs pixel-wise segmentation to classify the road and non-road areas, crucial for autonomous driving.

**4. Lane Detection Head :** Identifies lane markings on the road, helping vehicles stay in lanes.

**5. Postprocessing:** The outputs from these heads are post-processed to refine the segmentation maps and object detection results. This includes techniques like non-maximum suppression for object detection and upsampling for segmentation.
### **Training Strategy**
**Datasets:** The model is trained on datasets like BDD100K for object detection, lane detection, and segmentation tasks.

**Loss Functions :** HybridNets uses a combination of losses: cross-entropy for segmentation, focal loss for object detection, and specific losses for lane detection.

**Optimizations :** Techniques like mixed precision training, batch normalization, and augmentation are used to enhance the modelâ€™s performance and generalization.

**Output :** HybridNets outputs segmentation maps for drivable areas, lane markings, and bounding boxes for detected objects. This combination is especially useful in real-time applications like autonomous driving, where multiple tasks are handled simultaneously in a single forward pass.
